Hello! My name is Elliott, and I'm really excited to be starting this blog.

I am a Christian, a follower of Jesus.

I want to share how I have experienced Jesus' great love and graciousness in hope that you will be encouraged by these stories and want to experience Jesus for yourself.

Whether or not you know Jesus yet isn't important. This blog is intended to be seen by you.

My hope for this blog is that by sharing my experiences and encounters with Jesus, you will be encouraged to come and see who he is.
